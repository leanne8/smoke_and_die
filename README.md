Our main objective of the project is to find out, if any, the relationship between lung cancer and smoking cigarettes by looking at past data. We first plan to look at the population of smokers and those who suffer/suffered from lung cancer in each state within the United States. Then we will be taking a step further to determine the effects of oneâ€™s age, race, past smoking habits, etc, on the chance of raising lung cancer.
